## Multiple Devices Support
This project supports multiple devices in parallel for classification/detection. Please make sure you have already [set up environment](https://github.com/intel/ros_intel_movidius_ncs/tree/master#3-environment-setup) and [installed this project](https://github.com/intel/ros_intel_movidius_ncs/tree/master#4-building-and-installation) correctly.
### 1 Introduction
Movidius NCS SDK supported multiple NCS in parallel for acceleration. We integrate this feature into this project in v0.6.0 release. You can now accelerate your classification/detection for both image and stream input following below guides.
### 2 Arguments
|Arguments|Description|Default Value|Valid Values|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|max_device_number|max device number in one node|255|0~N-1(N is the maximum number of inserted available NCS devices)|
|start_device_index|start index of all inserted NCS devices in one node|0|0~N-1(N is the maximum number of inserted available NCS devices)|
### 3 Guide
In order to control the inserted devices, we add two arguments as described above. One example of how to use these arguments is in the launch files [ncs_camera.launch](https://github.com/intel/ros_intel_movidius_ncs/blob/devel/movidius_ncs_launch/launch/ncs_camera.launch) in line 42 and line 43. By default, one process will use at most 255 devices, and use the start index as 0.<br>
You can specify other choices of these arguments in your own launch files. Make sure they are in the valid scope.
### 4 Demo
Launch two object detection services on two consoles as comparison.
```Shell
roslaunch movidius_ncs_launch single_ncs_demo.launch cnn_type:=mobilenetssd
roslaunch movidius_ncs_launch multiple_ncs_demo.launch cnn_type:=mobilenetssd
```
Run the example application on another console. For example,
```Shell
roslaunch movidius_ncs_launch ncs_image_parallel_detection_example.launch image_base_path:=<absolute-image-directory>
```
